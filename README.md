# IBEX Tools

![Alt text](./IBEX.png?raw=true "IBEX")

This repo contains tools for manipulating IBEX data.   In general, these tools were developed to explore the representation of uncertainty in the data using a 2D colormap.  These tools are based on a Python class IBEX.   Ancillary tools are contained in the colortools.py file.

## Usage

Basic usage is:

1. Create ibex dataset from initial input CSV data
2. Create 2D Colormap (see MkMap below)
3. Run Viewer (see IBEX_Viewer below)

To create a separate ibex dataset from the input .csv files (in a 'data' subdirectory, I used the following script:

```
for i in `seq 2 6` ; do
  Csv2Ibx data/*_${i}.csv a.ibx
  HistoEq a.ibx flux b.ibx
  RelativeError b.ibx flux flux_se c.ibx
  BracketExposure c.ibx 3 13 0.2 d.ibx
  BracketExposure d.ibx 3 100 0.6 esa_${i}.ibx
  rm [abcd].ibx
done
```
This creates a separate .ibx file for each ESA level, with additional variables containing the histogram-equalized version of ***flux*** variable (***flux_he***), and two bracketted uncertainty variables.

## IBEX Class

The IBEX class represents an IBEX dataset.  This includes a set of *timesteps*.  Each timestep contains a set of *dependent variables*, defined as a 2D grid of scalar, floating point values, with one column for each unique longitude of the data and one row for each unique latitude.  If a particular location is not found in the original data a value of 0 will be used.

### IBEX Class Variables

- **names** a list of the timestep names.   From the names of the original CSV files.
- **varnames** a list of the variables in the data.   Each timestep must have the same set of variables
- **vardata** a list of numpy arrays containing the variable data ordered the same as **varnames**
- **resolution** the resolution of data.  All timesteps must be of the same resolution.

### IBEX Class Methods

- **Count()** Returns the number of timesteps
- **Add(name, varnames, vardata)** Add an additional timestep
- **AddFromSCSV(csv)**  Add an additional timestep read from a CSV file
- **Read(filename)** Read an instance stored in an *.ibx* file
- **Write(filename)** Save this instance to an .ibx* file
- **GetByIndex(indx)** Get [name, varnames, vardata] for the indexed timestep.   The varnames are a list of names; the vardata are a list of numpy arrays containing variable data.
- **GetByName(name)** Get [name, varnames, vardata] for the named timestep.   The varnames are a list of names; the vardata are a list of numpy arrays containing variable data.
- **Ranges()** Returns the min and max of each variable *over all timesteps*.
- **Resize(factor)**  Resize the data by *factor*.
- **Variable(name)**  Return the 3D data associated by with the variable name.   The first dimension ranges over the timesteps, the ramaining two correspond to [lat, lon].
- **Calculate(name, function)** Create a derived variable by applying  a function to the variables in the instance>
- **Sort()** Sort the timesteps lexicographically by the name.  One hopes original csv files have sensible names
- **Normalize()** Normalize the variables of the instance.  Each variable is normalized across the set of timesteps
- **Info()**  Print first a list of timestep names, then a list of variable names with the min and max of the corresponding variable

## Maps

Core to this work is the application of color maps to the data contained in the IBEX data.   Three maps are relevant: *1D colormaps* that map individual variable values to colors; *2D colormaps* which map two variables (think *signal* in the Y axis and *uncertainty* in the X axis) giving color, and *opacity maps*, mapping a range of normalized values to opacities.  Tools for handling these maps (as well as other random tools) are in the colortools.py file.

### 1D Colormaps

Internally, these are [256,3] numpy arrays containing normalized RGB for each of 256 levels.  Externally, these are represented simple csv files containing normalized RGB triples for each of 256 rows, and as Paraview .xml or .json format.   See Paraview for details.  Paraview-format data may be specified sparsely in arbitrary ranges; these are re-ranged and regularized upon input.

- **load_colormap(filename)** loads a colormap from the given file, normalizes it as necessary and returns it.
- **SaveColormap(cmap, name)** Save a colormap as a Paraview json-format file.
- **SaveColormapXML(cmap, name)** Save a colormap as a Paraview xml-format file.
- **ApplyColormap1D(value_array, colormap)**  Apply the given 1D colormap to an array of values.  Dimensionality increases by 1, with the fastest index representing [r, g, b].

###  1D Opacitymaps

Internally, these are [256] numpy arrays containing normalized opacities for each of 256 levels.  Externally, these are represented simple csv files containing normalized RGB triples for each of 256 rows, and as Paraview .xml or .json format.   See Paraview for details.  Paraview-format data may be specified sparsely in arbitrary ranges; these are re-ranged and regularized upon input.

- **load_opacitymap(filename)** loads an opacitymap from the given file, normalizes it as necessary and returns it.

### 2D Colormaps

Internally, these are [1024,1024,3] arrays that map a signal (the Y axis) and associated uncertainty (the X axis) to a color.  Externally, they are represented as binary data assumed to contained 1024*1024*3 float32 arrays.

- **ReadColormap2D(filename)** Read a 2D colormap from a file
- **WriteColormap2D(filename)** Write a 2D colormap to a file
- **ApplyColormap(signal, uncertainty, cmap)** Apply the 2D colormap to equal-sized arrays containing normalized signal and uncertainty values.

## Command-line Tools

Command line tools are included in the repo.   TO use these conveniently, add the repo root directory to your PATH environment variable.

- **MkMap sigmap [-r] [-nodisplay] [-e uncertainty_map] [-E uncertainty_value] [-o omap]** Create a 2D colormap.  The map will interpolate from the sigmap on the left to the uncertainty map on the right, which may be a constant greyscale value given by the -E parameter, defaulting to 0.4.  By default the 2D colormap will be displayed unless the [-nodisplay] flag is given.  The interpolation will be linear unless the [-o omap] argument is given; if it is, it will control the interpolation.   If the [-r] option is given, the sigmap will be reversed.  The output file will be named according to the sigmap, the uncertainty mapping, and the interpolation model.
- **Csv2Ibx csv [csv...] ibx** read a set of csv files in original format into an IBEX instance and save it as an ibx file
- **ApplyCmap2D ibx cmap sigvar relvar directory** Apply the given 2D colormap to the specified variables in the input data file, produucing one image file for each timestep
- **Ibex2Gscale ibx varname** render a grey-scale image of the named variable of each timestep of the data.
- **VarNames ibx** List the variable names contained in the ibx file
- **DatasetNames ibx** List the timestep names contained in the ibx file
- **ToCMoves ibx [-l level] [-s scale]** produce a set of data files for input to ColorMoves.  The -l parameter allows you to specify an ESA level (defaulting to all of them); the -s scale allows you to scale the output images by a factor.  ***Note - this may be out of date***

### Cacluate-based tools

Several tools are included to create derived variables using the IBEX class' Calculate method.

- **BracketExposure in.ibx low high max_uncertainty out.ibx**  Creates a derived uncertainty variable from the *exposure_time* variable.  Values less than *low* are considered fully unreliable, and receive the maximum uncertainty value.   Values greater than *high* are considered fully reliable, and receive a value of 0.  Intervening values are interpolated linearly.
- **HistoEq in.ibx varname out.ibx** applies a histogram equalization algorithm to the named variable, producing a derived variable named **varname_he**.
- **RelativeError in.ibx signame abserrname out.ibx** Divides the absolute error variable named by *abserrname* by the signal variable named *signame*  producing a relative error variable named *sigvar_re*.
- **Normalize in.ibx varname out.ibx** Normalize the named variable *across all timesteps*, producing a derived variable named *varname_n*.

** IBEX_Viewer

This application is used for testing colormaps against the data in an ibx file.  Run it **IBEX_Viewer file.ibx**.

The tool shows four main panels.   

### Upper Left

The upper left panel shows the *signal* data.  The pulldown at the top allows the user to select the signal variable.   By default, *flux* (if it exists) is used.    All data variables are available in the pulldown.   A ***...*** button at the bottom allows you to select a one-dimensioned colormap to use in this panel.


### Lower Left

The upper left panel shows the *uncertainty* data.  The pulldown at the top allows the user to select a variable to use for uncertainty.   By default, *flux_re* (if it exists) is used.    All data variables *that are entirely contained in the range[0 ... 1] are available in the pulldown.   A ***...*** button at the bottom allows you to select a one-dimensioned colormap to use in this panel.

### Upper right 

This shows the result of 2D mapping the signal and uncertainty data.  A ***...*** button allows the user to select a 2D colormap for this panel.

### Lower right

On the left are histograms of the signal data (top) and the uncertainty data (bottom) and the current 2D colormap.

### Bottom

A ribbon at the bottom allows the yuser to choose a specifc timestep or to step through the set of timesteps.

### The File pulldown

A pulldown on the menu bar presents the ability to save an image of the current timestep data with the current 2D colormap applied, and the ability to save *all* timesteps with the given 2D colormap.
